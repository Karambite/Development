# ACM Development Developer

By joining _ACM_ Development as a developer, we expect you to work in an agile environment with a team of like-minded, talented, fast-paced developers with a passion to make an impact on the student community here at UT Dallas. 

### Pre-requisite knowledge

_ACM_ Development is the pinnacle of software engineering opportunities offered by _ACM_. Our goal is to deliver high quality production software to be used by students across the community. This requires our teams to be able to operate efficiently and therefore we require a minimum level of skill from our applicants. The skill/tech stack requirements vary based on the specific project but having a background in the domain will improve your chances of joining the teams. Each of our projects involves a simple technical challenge to solve that tests if the student has the necessary background to be successful. 

We do not expect you to be an expert in all facets of the projects. Our projects use a wide range of technologies and therefore it is not expected that every student already be familiar with how the project is structured. For most projects, a background in the language and base framework being used will suffice and the rest can be learned once part of the team.

### Becoming a Developer

Joining _ACM_ Development as a Developer involves committing to the vision of the project and team. It involves participating effectively in all parts of the development process and being an engaged member of _ACM_ Development. Outlined are the steps to join as a developer.

There exists a three stage process in becoming a Developer
 - Fill out the [typeform](https://apply.acmutd.co/dev) to show interest in becoming a Developer.
 - Once your application is processed complete a series of small technical challenges sent to you over the period of a two weeks to demonstrate willingness to participate.
 - Upon successful completion of all challenges meet with the Director of Development & Dev Officer to discuss the time commitment, tech stack, expectations and more.

These stages will replace for _ACM_ Development that standard process of application and interview. Do understand that the lack of an interview is no substitute for lack of communication.
