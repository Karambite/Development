# ACM Development Officer

### Dev Officer expectations

When joining _ACM_ Development as a Dev Officer we expect that you are technically capable in leading a project from start to completion. We expect that you will be able to select ideal languages, libraries, and frameworks to enable us to create reliable and quality software. There is no one specific prerequisite technical skill that we look for in our officers, however, being able to know at least one domain well is beneficial. 

By being a Dev Officer, you will learn how to manage a project from start to end, take responsibility for not just coding but also choosing the ideal frameworks and deployment strategies. These are valuable skills to possess and _ACM_ Development an ideal environment to nurture them.

### Becoming a Dev Officer

Joining _ACM_ Development as a Dev Officer means accepting an important degree of responsibility. Each Dev Officer is expected to manage their individual project and at their discretion optionally work with additional developers. They are also expected to contribute to maintaining existing _ACM_ codebases with a portion of their time and complete any tasks assigned by the Director of Development. 

There exists a four stage process in becoming a Dev Officer
 - Fill out the [typeform](https://apply.acmutd.co/dev) to show interest in becoming a Dev Officer.
 - Once your application is processed complete a series of small technical challenges sent to you over a two week period to demonstrate willingness to participate.
 - Submit a proposal for a project that will be developed under _ACM_ Development. Understand that if accepted, the Dev Officer will be responsible for its development and completion throughout the semester. Read [Dev Officer expectations](./readme.md) for more information
 - Upon successful completion of all challenges & submission of a proposal meet with the Director of Development for a 1v1 to discuss the scope, timeline, projected growth and development of the project.

These stages will replace for _ACM_ Development that standard process of application and interview. Do understand that the lack of an interview is no substitute for lack of communication. 

#### Questions

Sometimes you may have additional questions. If the answer was not found in this readme please feel free to reach out to the [Director of Development](mailto:development@acmutd.co) for _ACM_

We request that you be as detailed as possible in your questions, doubts or concerns to ensure that we can be of maximum assistance. Thank you!
