# Title

Brief introduction to the project. Tags for build status and other relevant information. Links to additional resources such as a wiki or other readmes.

### Motivation

Short description as to why the project was created in the first place. 

### Quick Start

How to run the project. Keep this as short as possible, including only cloning, bare minimum configuration (if any), and running a start script. May include serperate links to stable and latest development releases.
#### Scripts
Be sure to **wrap**  terminal commands or bits of code that are one line with a ( **\`** ), and/or three ( **\`\`\`** ) for bits of code that are multiple lines. This takes advantage of .md's ability to format code, which makes finding important snippets of code easier.
**EXAMPLE:**
1. First create an .env file with the following fields:
```npm start
GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY="vision key"
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="maps key"
ANOTHER_ENV_VAR="value"
```
2. Then open Terminal, and use `npm start` to start the server.
