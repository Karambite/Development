# Documentation
Writing documentation is perhaps one of the most important parts of working in a team environment. In this readme we will dicuss the _5_ key domains that will shed light on the best practices that we at the _Assosication for Computing Machinery_ seek to follow. 

 - __What__ to document
 - __Where__ to document
 - __Why__ to document
 - __Whom__ we document for
 - __When__ to document

### Who do we document for?

Our documentation should focus on addressing the needs of _3_ primary stakeholders in a given project. It can appear daunting to write documentation when there is a lack of clarity about the target audience. To cast light on the people reading we can broadly group them into the following hierarchical categories.

##### Categories
 - Development Team
 - Organizational Partners
 - Outside Community

We can analyze the needs of each of these groupings and thereby understand how best to address them through our documentation. Below is a short description of each of the groupings, detailed explanations of why each is relevant is covered in the [why](./documentation.md) section.

###### Development Team
The development team comprises of yourself and your fellow contributors to the project. Your team works on a daily basis with the code and is more familiar with the intricate inner workings of it than anyone else. 

###### Organizational Partners
Partners at the organizational level correspond to the people who may not be directly involved in your project but have an active presence and interest in its development. Typically these include senior leadership, marketing & sales teams, and developers that may be working on other projects. Together all of these people have a strong vested interest in the success of the project. In mant situations these partners may be the end users of the application being created.

###### Outside Community
The outside community represents all people that may show a curious interest in learning more about this application but are not involved in the direct creation, maintainance or usage of the software. As projects gain a strong foundation and start moving in the direction of becoming open source the outside community starts to pick up in importance. 

### What do we document?


### Where do we document?

Documentation exists in a variety of different forms. We need to care about each of them to ensure we maximize the value gained. Tasks, issues, calendars, schedules, progress, technical architecture and the many more forms dicussed early in the [what]() we document section are not all stored in the same place. The ideal locations for each type of information need to adequately satisfy the _4_ crucial facets. CRUD.
 - Create
 - Read
 - Update
 - Delete

The first thought here might be that isn't CRUD the role of an application or database? That is correct, our documentation much like an application satifies a need and the location it is available at needs to ensure that those _4_ facets are possible. Below we will discuss where we at _ACM_ store our various documentation and how those locations meet the requirements listed. 

##### Github
GitHub is at the heart of where our technical documentation is stored. The vast majority of information required for all relevant stakeholders can easily be accessed and modified with the tools available on GitHub. 

 - Issues
   - GitHub issues are an effective way to track future work that needs to be completed and provide an estimate for completion times. It also provides non-development stakeholders a simple way to view the task lists for the issues and understand what will be addressed in the code. 
 - Pull Requests
   - _ACM_ prides itself on ensuring that all pull requests are detailed and contain all the relevant information required to understand the changes made to the codebase. This applies not just to repositories that contain code but also additionally to the repositories where we store
