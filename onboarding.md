# _ACM Development_

Welcome to the team as a Dev Officer for Summer 2020! You are here because you showed the qualities that we look for --> __Determination__, __Leadership__ and __Passion__. Each of you have passed a series of technical challenges that were aimed to ensure that you have the skills necessary for success. Your skills in project management and leadership are also evident in the proposals that were submitted. These proposals will serve as the outline for the project and will help chart progress over the course of the semester

### Summer 2020

Over the course of Summer 2020, we will build these projects from start to completion. The goal is to make them available to full use by the acm community by the Fall Kickoff event. Keeping to the timeline present in the development proposals is important and we will ensure that your success in these projects is a priority. While it is still early, I encourage thinking about how best to improve adoption of our projects by the community once it has reached completion. 

### Timeline

Since we are remote and unable to meet in-person it is very important to adhere to a timeline and have checkpoints along the way to ensure progress. For this summer, most of yout time and energy can be devoted towards your personal projects with minimal overhead due to the lack of frequent ACM events. Below is additional information on when the checkpoints are and how to submit progress markers.

##### Checkpoints 

As previously mentioned, _ACM Development_ will operate on a two week sprint basis. The following Fridays represent the end of weeks where checkpoints are due. By the first checkpoint it is important to solidify team structure, provide access to relevant and required resources, have a clear breakdown of what to start working on and understand the summer timeline.

 - May 15
 - May 29
 - June 12
 - June 26
 - July 10
 - July 24
 - August 7
 - August 21
 - Fall Kickoff

##### Demo

For each checkpoint the requirement is that there is improvement in the project development from the previous checkpoint. Typically during the course of a normal semester, we would set up for an in person demo. The purpose of these demos is to receive feedback and constrcutive critism from the team. Understandably for the summer semester it will be challenging to coordinate all the members who are working on these projects to come together at the same time given constraints such as internships and other responsibilities. Therefore, the expectation here is that the Dev Officer for a given project will set up for a demo time in the week leading up to the checkpoint with the Director of Development. This demo will be recorded and be available to all developers so that the Dev Officer can receive their input on the work completed. Being a Dev Officer means that you are expected to be willing to review other demos and provide feedback. This is a team effort. 

During the demo the Dev Officer will be expected to cover the below listed points. This will ensure that the team understands not only how much progress was made but also allow them to draw from their experience and provide valuable suggestions and tips. It is this collaborative atmosphere that we seek to cultivate here at _ACM Development_.
 - Showcase new feature/enhancement added from previous demo
 - Discuss what will be developed next
 - Talk about any obstacles that the team is working around
 - Mention how if any obstacles were solved from the previous week (this is especially important because many of the typical obstacles faced such as authentication, database access, permissions management, deployment are universal to almost all teams)
 - Something new that you've learned over the past two weeks

### Team

As indicated by your proposals, many of you have already elected to work alongside an existing ACM officer for your projects. In addition to this, there are many other ACM officers who have indicated that they would be interested to work with the selected Dev Officers on their projects. It is completely up to your discretion as a Dev Officer whether you choose to allow additional team members to join and provide their support. 

### Conclusion

Welcome to the team!
