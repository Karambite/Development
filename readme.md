## About

_ACM_ Development is the newest division of _ACM_. Keeping to the culture of autonomy and innovation being key in an individual's role, in this division we provide our officers the independance to follow their passion in developing the next generation of software that powers the community to new heights. Learn how to join at the bottom.

#### Summer 2020?

_ACM_ Development will be creating projects over the summer! If your proposal to join (at the bottom) is accepted you have the opportunity to build an amazing project between May - August 2020!

#### What do we do?

_ACM_ Development will follow two primary avenues of growth. 
 - The first will be building tools that improve the workflow of current _ACM_ officers. The purpose here is to simplify the routines and tasks that our hardworking officers do and allow them to spend their time better engaging the target audience. Popular projects that already fall into this category include the _ACM_ Discord Bot and TrackIT. Both tools are designed to help officers execute their duties in a more effective manner allowing for us to have much greater productivity.
 - The second will be to build software whose target audience is the UT Dallas student community. In this situation, we will strive to better understand the needs of fellow students and design software that targets the issues they face. This will allow for _ACM_ to have a stronger reputation on our campus as the leading forerunner for technology that solves the everyday student problem. An extremely well used and widespread example of a project that falls into this category would be UTD Grades. The goal here is to support the overall student community and build a strong software stack used by thousands.

#### What skills will we develop?

When joining _ACM_ Development as a Dev Officer we expect that you are technically capable in leading a project from start to completion. We expect that you will be able to select ideal languages, libraries, and frameworks to enable us to create reliable and quality software. There is no one specific prerequisite technical skill that we look for in our officers, however, being able to know at least one domain well is beneficial. 

By being a Dev Officer, you will learn how to manage a project from start to end, take responsibility for not just coding but also choosing the ideal frameworks and deployment strategies. These are valuable skills to possess and _ACM_ Development an ideal environment to nurture them.

#### What's the timeline like?

The standard we are setting for projects designed by _ACM_ Development will be to go from start to MVP in under a semester. Project planning and proposal submission will happen in the transition between semesters and the expectation is that we have demoable material every two weeks. Projects upon completion that are received well by the _ACM_ and student community can be continued to be enhanced in future semesters.

#### Where are current projects?

All current projects and code written by _ACM_ officers are stored in the _ACM_ Organization on GitHub. For reference of what a aproject managed under _ACM_ Development will look like in terms of branching strategies, PR management, documentation, issue reporting/labelling, etc refer to TrackIT.

#### Why _ACM_ Development?

_ACM_ Development seeks to provide the resources and support necessary to empower developers to creaate projects that leave a long last impact upon the student community. In addition to providinga solid structure and timelines, _ACM_ will leverage its expertise to promote, share and grow the software solutions developed by our Dev Officers. Furthermore, we provide a collaborative environment with fellow developers who share a common unified goal.

## Team

#### What is the team structure?

_ACM_ Development will consist of the Director of Development, a team of Dev Officers and additional developers on individual projects. Each project managed by _ACM_ Development will be run by a single Dev Officer who may at their discretion have additional developers working together with them on parts of the project. For the upcoming Summer & Fall 2020 Semesters, we will have between 4-5 Dev Officers.

#### Director of Development

_ACM_ Development will consist of one Director of Development representing the team on the _ACM_ Board. The responsibilities of the Director include:
 - Communicating across Dev Officers to determine big picture progress and growth of project
 - Working with ACM Divisions to perform requirements engineering and translate business requirements to ordered technical specifications
 - Assign relevant work across different _ACM_ Development Projects to relevant officers for completion
 - Provide adequate resources and support for Dev Officers to maximize their success and empower _ACM_ through their development
 - Explore big picture project life cycles and assist Dev Officers in innovating to collaborate on larger goals

#### Dev Officer

Each Dev Officer will be expected to lead a single project from conception to conclusion each semester. Being a Dev Officer is an elevation of role from just a developer. The privelage of leading an entire project will mean that there are additional responsibilities. The responsibilities for each Dev Officer include:
 - Design a proposal for a feasable project that supports one of the two pillars of _ACM_ Development. Proposal must include both information on the practical usage of the application as well as the technical requirements
 - Present an estimated timeline for completion of the project (maximum of one semester) MVP should be complete by the 10 week mark.
 - Work with any additional developers how would like to take an interest in coding for _ACM_
 - Demo project every two weeks to show completion of new features to the Director of Development and any other interested officers
 - Be responsible for all aspects for one individual project 
 - Document project for future use
 - In addition to working on their personal projects all dev officers will be expected to help maintain existing _ACM_ codebases such as the general _ACM_ Website. 
 - General tasks to update, clean and maintain existing projects will be directly assigned to Dev Officers by the Director of Development and must be completed within a week. 
 - The general expectation is that each Dev Officer will split their workload in a 70/30 balance where 70% of their time is spent completing their individual project and the remaining 30% of time on assigned tasks.
 - It is important for Dev Officers to continually innovate within their position and take their project to newer heights by thinking about how to continue building on it with additional features after the end of the semester.

Dev Officers will receive strikes if any of the following conditions are violated:
 - Failure to show demo with changes in a 2 week sprint, sometimes we understand that exams and assignments can get in the way and therefore each Dev Officer will have a full one week interval to present their updates. 
 - Failure to complete any task assigned by Director of Development within a one week time period. 
 - Failure to communicate to in a timely manner (48 hours) to any messages from the Director of Development
 - Failure to comply with set of pre-determined requirements on managing project timelines, code requirements, documentation requirements, etc.

#### Dev Officer vs Developer?

_ACM_ Development seeks to provide everyone the opportunity to matter how small their contributions to support the culture of innovation in our organization. However, we recognize that individual projects need leadership and guidance from both a technical and organizational perspective. _ACM_ Development looks to our Dev Officers to take on that role. As with any officer role, the process to join is selective to ensure that we have the necessary talent and passion within the team to see a project from start to end. Each Dev Officer can at their discretion choose to work with any other developer on their project to see it to completion. At the same time, any _ACM_ officer that feels that they would like to contribute in their small way either through code or suggestions is more than welcome to reach out to the Dev Officer in charge of a project. We encourage the _ACM_ community to support our projects and know that our Dev Officers would appreciate the time invested by fellow developers. 

## Join

#### How to join

Joining _ACM_ Development as a Dev Officer means accepting an important degree of responsibility. Each Dev Officer is expected to manage their individual project and at their discretion optionally work with additional developers. They are also expected to contribute to maintaining existing _ACM_ codebases with a portion of their time and complete any tasks assigned by the Director of Development. 

There exists a two stage process in becoming a Dev Officer from Summer 2020. 
 - Complete a series of small technical challenges over the period of a week to demonstrate interest and willingness to participate.
 - Submit a proposal for a project that will be developed under _ACM_ Development. Understand that if accepted, the Dev Officer will be responsible for its development and completion throughout the semester. Read Dev Officer expectations for more information

These stages will replace for _ACM_ Development that standard process of application and interview. Do understand that lack of an interview is no substitute for lack of communication. 

#### Technical Challenge

Congrats if you've made it down this far, here's the set of small technical challenges we'd like to see solved. We strongly encourage you to try your luck at these even if being a Dev Officer is not your primary goal. Completion of these challenges will indicate that you are ready to learn new tools and push through obstacles in your journey. 

Note: These technical challenges are not meant to assess your prowess as a coder. We cannot expect everyone to be a master at all the various programming domains. The idea here is to challenge one's skills at problem solving and creativity. Some of these challenges may not even involve writing any code.

All the challenges can be found at [acm-dev-challenges](http://acm-dev-challenge.surge.sh/)

Below is a short summary of the challenges and what skill they are designed to assess
 - Challenge 1
   - Knowing how to use Git/Github and collaborative tools. This introductory challenge is designed to ensure that our officers have the foundational skills required to develop a team project
 - Challenge 2
   - Knowing how to use a simple API. This challenge involves writing code with the flexibility provided to choose any language or gramework that the developer is comfortable using. This challenge is designed to ensure that our officers have the minimum technical expertise to work with the available tools.
 - Challenge 3
   - Knowing how to think outside the box. This challenge involves no code whatsoever and is meant to be more of a puzzle. This challenge is designed to ensure that our officers are able to think creatively and apply their problem solving skills without giving up.

#### Project Proposal

The project proposal is one of the key parts of becoming a Dev Officer. This will demonstrate the ability to be creative, innovate and showcase leadership in project management. Our expectation here is that this is project will be something that the Dev Officer is passionate about and willing to see it come to life within the _ACM_ community. Here are the requirements for proposals submitted:

 - Short summary of what the project is, who the target audience is and why it would be a benefit to them
 - Breakdown of project timeline over the course of a semester
 - Feasability report to understand if the minimum goals for this project can be accomplished in one semester
 - Technical specifications for the project
 - Potential obstacles or roadblocks that may happen during project development
 - Why would you like to build this project?

This proposal will replace the application/interview process for admission into _ACM_ Development as a Dev Officer

#### Where do I submit? 

For the technical challenges once you've followed all the instructions and finished adding your solutions into a git repo, shoot the link over to the Director of Development for review.

Check the _ACM_ Slack Workspace for the _acm_dev_ channel, more information will be posted on there regarding proposal submission. Feel free to also use the channel to bounce ideas off of fellow officers and work together in solving the technical challenges. However, understand that each individual must have their own proposal to be considered for the Dev Officer position.

#### What if I have more questions?

Ask around in the above mentioned channel or feel free to ask the Director of Development for any clarifications.
