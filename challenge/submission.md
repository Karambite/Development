# Submission

Thank you for considering applying to _ACM_ Development. If you haven't already filled out the [Typeform](https://apply.acmutd.co/dev) to indicate your interest in developing, please do so first before starting on the technical challenges. These challenges have been created to set a minimum bar for ensuring that the developers and officers who join _ACM_ Development are capable of working with other seasoned teammates on a pre-existing tech stack. 

### Requirements
 - All Dev Officer or developer applicants _must_ complete [Challenge 0](./chal-0/chal-0.md).
 - If you are applying to be a developer on a specific team, please complete their respective challenge to be considered:
    - Comet Planning: [Challenge 2](./chal-2/chal-2.md)
    - Kluster: [Challenge 3](./chal-3/chal-3.md)
    - TrackIT: [Challenge 4](./chal-4/chal-4.md)
 - If you indicated that you would like to work on other new projects that will be created by _ACM_ Development complete [Challenge 1](./chal-1/chal-1.md).
 - If you would like to apply to multiple projects please complete all their respective challenges. 
 - If you applied to be a Dev Officer, complete Challenge 1 and, in addition, two additional challenges of your choice.

### Submission
Create a repository on GitHub for saving the code from completing the challenges. Ensure that this repository is public so that we can view your code after submission. Within your repository create folders titled `chal-0`, `chal-`... and so on to represent the different challenges that you complete. After completing the necessary challenges as part of your application save your code and submit the link to your repository in [challenge submission](https://survey.acmutd.co/dev) form.

You do not need to complete all the challenges to be considered for a position in _ACM_ Development, but you are welcome to do so to be considered for joining the different teams.

### Timeline
Since _ACM_ Development operates in an asynchronous fashion and our projects extend beyond the scale of a single semester, there is no deadline to complete these challenges. Of course, the earlier you complete them, the better your chances of joining a team with _ACM_ Development. We advise that you take your time to complete these challenges to the best of your abilities and additionally use them as a learning opportunity to learn tools or technologies that you are unfamiliar with. We look forward to reviewing your submission, and thank you for considering _ACM_ Development!

#### Questions
You may have additional questions. If the answer was not found in this readme, please feel free to reach out to the [Director of Development](mailto:development@acmutd.co) for _ACM_ or make a post in the #development-general channel in the ACM UTD [Discord](http://acmutd.co/discord) server.

We request that you be as detailed as possible in your questions, doubts or concerns to ensure that we can be of maximum assistance. Thank you!
