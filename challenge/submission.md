# Submission

Thank you for considering applying to ACM Development. If you haven't already filled out the [typeform](https://apply.acmutd.co/dev) to indicate your interest in developing please do so first before starting on the technical challenges. These challenges have been created to set a minimum bar for ensuring that the developers and officers who join _ACM_ Development are capable of working with other seasoned teammates on a pre-existing tech stack. 

### Requirements
 - All applicants for both being a Dev Officer or Developer _must_ complete [Chal-0](./chal-0/chal-0.md)
 - If you are applying to be a developer on a specific team please complete their respective challenge to be considered --> [Comet Planning - Chal-2](./chal-2/chal-2.md), [Kluster - Chal-3](./chal-3/chal-3.md), or [TrackIT - Chal-4](./chal-4/chal-4.md)
 - If you indicated that you would like to work on other new projects that will be created by _ACM_ Development complete [Chal-1](./chal-1/chal-1.md)
 - If you would like to apply to multiple projects please complete all the challenges for those projects. 
 - If you applied to be a Dev Officer, in addition to `chal-0` please complete 2 additional challenges of your choice.

### Submission

Create a repository on GitHub for saving the code from completing the challenges. Ensure that this repository is public so that we can view your code after submission. Within your repository create folders titled `chal-0`, `chal-`... and so on to represent the different challenges that you complete. After completing the necessary challenges as part of your application save your code and submit the link to your repository in the form below

You do not need to complete all the challenges to be considered for a position in _ACM_ Development but you are welcome to do so to be considered for joining the different teams.

### Timeline

Since _ACM_ Development operates in an asynchronous fashion and our projects extend beyond the scale of just a single semester there is no deadline to complete these challenges by. Of course the earlier you complete them the better your chances of joining a team with _ACM_ Development. We advise that you take your time to complete these challenges to the best of your abilities and use them additionally as a learning opportunity if there are tools/technologies/tech stacks that you are unfamiliar with. We look forward to reviewing your submission & thank you for considering _ACM_ Development!
